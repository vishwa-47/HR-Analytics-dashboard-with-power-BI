## questions answered using this dashboard
1.	What is the attrition rate across different age groups?
2.	Does education level impact employee attrition?
3.	Which job roles have the highest attrition rates? 
4.	How does attrition vary across different salary ranges?
5.	Does attrition occur more in early years of employment or later years?

## Project insight
1.	Attrition rate is too high where most of the companies try to keep their attrition rate below 10%.
2.	People from Life science and medical field background are the most common employees who left the organization.
3.	The highest attrition rate is among the age group 26-35 
4.	Most of the employees earning below 5K have left the organization
5.	Most of the attrition happens when employees gain 2 â€“ 3 years of experience

## To overcome this attrition challenge 
1.	Enhance early career development programs 
2.	Review and adjust salary structures
3.	Strengthen employee engagement initiatives.
4.	Conduct exit interviews and feedback analysis.
